# 👋 Hi, I'm Serhat Çakı

## 🎓 Computer Programming Student

I completed 4 years in technical high school; the first 2 years were foundational education, and the last 2 years I focused intensively on web development and databases, gaining practical experience. After graduation, my passion for software development continued, and I developed personal projects to enhance my skills.

I mainly work on frontend and backend development but also have a strong interest in automation and bot development. I have intermediate to advanced knowledge in C++, C#, and Python and create various automation tools.

I enjoy keeping up with new technologies and continuously improving myself. My goal is to apply what I learn in practical projects and build comprehensive and useful solutions.
